The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices (such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm. 
Due to limitations of mtp devices, tracks which are listened to for any length of time (including skipped tracks) will have a playcount added and so be scrobbled. I also have no way to tell what time a song was listen to, and so the ordering will be inaccurate.
For now, the program will be console based, and for UNIX enviroments, in the future I plan to make the code cross platform, perhaps with a GUI.


Known issues:
Deletion doesn't work 100% correcly, though it will work if all scrobbles are successful.
mtp-tools sometimes doesn't want to connect to the device, there is nothing I can do about this.
Tracks with non-ascii characters wont get scrobbled eg. bands like Sigur Rós, Röyksopp. I'm trying to work out a solution for this
