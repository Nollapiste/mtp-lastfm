This is Release 0.1 of mtp-lastfm.  The old cli version is available from the cli repository.

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices
(such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm. 

Current features:
Scrobbling for multiple accounts and devices.

Future release:
View/Ban/Love tracks before scrobbling

Due to limitations of mtp devices, tracks which are listened to for any length of time
(including skipped tracks) will have a playcount added and so be scrobbled. I also
have no way to tell what time a song was listen to, and so the ordering will be inaccurate.

Known issues:
mtp-tools sometimes doesn't want to connect to the device, there is nothing I can do about this.

Dependencies:
Python
python-sqlite
sqlite3
mtp-tools
py-gtk
gtk
gtk-glade
