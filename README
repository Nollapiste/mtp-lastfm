The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices
(such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm. 
Due to limitations of mtp devices, tracks which are listened to for any length of time
(including skipped tracks) will have a playcount added and so be scrobbled. I also
have no way to tell what time a song was listen to, and so the ordering will be inaccurate.
For now, the program will be console based, and for UNIX enviroments

Future plans:
cross platform
A GUI
Use a songs rating to decide if it should be scrobbled
eg. A rating of 1 = ban, a rating of 5 = love this track
Better timestamping


Known issues:
Fixed: Deletion doesn't work 100% correctly, though it will work if all scrobbles are successful.
mtp-tools sometimes doesn't want to connect to the device, there is nothing I can do about this.
Fixed: Tracks with non-ascii characters wont get scrobbled eg. bands like Sigur Rós, Röyksopp. I'm
trying to work out a solution for this.
