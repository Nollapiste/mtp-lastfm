h2. MTP-Lastfm 0.82

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices (such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm.  You can love, ban and tag tracks before scrobbling, and also use the ratings on your device (5=Love, 1=Ban).

The program can be run from the source directory, or installed using distutils
To run from source: ./mtp-lastfm
Install: python setup.py install (as superuser)
There are also deb packages available from the "PPA repository":https://launchpad.net/~mtp-lastfm/+archive/ppa

h3. This software wont work with the following players:
* Zune (requires authentication)
* iRiver Clix2 (doesn't track playcount)
This isn't an exhaustive list obviously, just what people have told me. Please let me know if your player doesn't work so I can add it to this list.

h3. Dependencies:
* python
* python-sqlite
* sqlite3
* mtp-tools
* py-gtk
* gtk
* gtk-glade
* python-elementtree 

Apart from mtp-tools and python-elementtree these should be installed by default on Ubuntu/Debian.
