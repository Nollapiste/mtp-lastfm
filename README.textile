h2. MTP-Lastfm

The purpose of this program is to scrobble tracks from mtp devices
(such as the Creative Zen, or the Zune) to last.fm.  You can Love/Ban tracks before scrobbling, and also use the ratings on your device (5=Love, 1=Ban).

You can download a deb file "here":http://github.com/woodenbrick/mtp-lastfm/downloads
